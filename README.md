Using maching learning to predict the stock market

##Overview

This is the code for the Stock Price Prediction. The code uses the [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) machine learning library to train a [support vector regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) on a stock price dataset from [Google Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) to predict a future price.

##Dependencies

First term is very fun, the second is a bit rough on math but I do appreciate having that knowledge; at the end of the day, that's what the job is going to be like. What I do not appreciate is students posting the answers for the project on the web, even on the forum. Even Siraj Raval posted a video on car cloning behavior; that just makes the nanodegree less prestigious, especially for  someone who is paying for it.
